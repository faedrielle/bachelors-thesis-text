Before I elaborate further on the given topic, I will introduce a few important concepts.

\textbf{IoT - Internet of Things} - \textit{The interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data} \cite{IoT-dictionary} without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. \cite{IoT-definition-no-interaction}

\textbf{PoC - Proof of Concept} - \textit{Evidence, typically deriving from an experiment or pilot project, which demonstrates that a design concept, business proposal, etc. is feasible.} \cite{PoC-dictionary}

Before I start elaborating further on the given topic, I would like to introduce a few important concepts.

\textbf{IoT - Internet of Things} - \textit{The interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data.}\cite{IoT-dictionary}

\textbf{PoC - Proof of Concept} - \textit{Evidence, typically deriving from an experiment or pilot project, which demonstrates that a design concept, business proposal, etc. is feasible.} \cite{PoC-dictionary}

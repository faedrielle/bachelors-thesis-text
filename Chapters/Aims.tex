The aim of this thesis is to analyse and design the functionality of an IoT solution for assessment of tourist track difficulty, based on the individual's fitness.

The early chapters of this thesis will be the analysis of the ways fitness is currently assessed and their relevance to my application,
followed by a study of existing applications in the domain of fitness trackers and e-health, and an assessment of how important specific features are to the applications' main aims.
I am going to apply the results of this research to my own approach when determining the required functionality for the system.

Based on these descriptions, I am going to design the front-end of a mobile application for track selection and data visualization.
I am also going to design a high-level architecture of the IoT solution.

In the last part of the thesis I am going to focus on implementing a PoC of the designed solution and processing of collected data.

The aim of this thesis is to analyse and design the functionality \todo{reword} of an IoT solution for assessment of tourist track difficulty, based on the individual's fitness.

In the theoretical chapters I will analyse existing applications in the domain of fitness trackers and e-health, assess the importance of specific features to the application's main usecases
and apply the results of this research to my own approach when determining the requirements for the system.
Based on these requirements, I will design the front-end of a mobile application for track selection and data visualization.
I will also design the overall architecture of the PoC solution.

In the practical part of the thesis I will focus on implementing a PoC of the designed solution - a mobile phone application for data collection and a platform for data receiving, with emphasis on usage of relevant data science methods. \todo{reword}

The aim of this thesis is to analyse and design the functionality of an IoT solution for assessment of tourist track difficulty, based on the individual's fitness.

In the early chapters I will analyse the ways fitness is currently assessed and their relevance to my application.
Later on, I will study existing applications in the domain of fitness trackers and e-health, assess the importance of specific features to the applications' main aims
and apply the results of this research to my own approach when determining the requirements for the system.

Based on these requirements, I will design the front-end of a mobile application for track selection and data visualization.
I will also design the overall architecture of the PoC solution.

In the last part of the thesis I will focus on implementing a PoC of the designed solution - an application for a wearable device for data collection, a mobile phone application for data relaying and a platform for data receiving and processing.

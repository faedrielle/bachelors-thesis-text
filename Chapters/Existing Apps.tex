There's a plethora of applications taking advantage of wearable tech, not all of them using the available bio sensors, ranging from basic real-time heart rate monitoring to progress tracking, to calorie measuring, and to social network sized fitness communities.

In this chapter I will research a few such applications, compare and rate them based on following criteria. \todo{add weight to individual points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use of IoT possibilities -- use of available sensors, data collection from the community,
    \item User fitness assessment -- how the user's fitness is assessed (attempt self-assessment, fill out a questionnaire, or take a physical test),
    \item Track difficulty assessment -- how the track's difficulty is assessed (user-reported, or calculated)
    \item Community -- built-in sharing options, possibility for interaction between users,
    \item Extra features -- interesting perks outside of the scope of my app,
    \item User-friendliness -- navigation around the mobile application - finding the general settings, creating and clearing a route, general user experience,
    \item Availability -- is the application or its parts free, paid or are there microtransactions,
    \item Cross-platform -- major operating systems supporting the mobile application and sensors, if any are used,
    \item Propriety -- whether the solution is open-source, closed-source or else.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{komoot}
The cross-platform application for outdoor track suggestion can also be used as a tour planner, a map and a navigation system.

\todo[color = green]{add numeric ratings}

\subsubsection*{Use of IoT possibilities}
Given its use of GPS sensors, komoot does qualify as a basic IoT system, however, it also relies heavily on user input for track rating.
The smart watch only gets used for displaying of routes and navigation, not taking any advantage of the available sensors.
\subsubsection*{User fitness assessment}
When a user is creating a route, they can set its difficulty as one of five levels, 
describing the user's self-reported physical fitness and their current taste for a challenge (or lack thereof): Couch Potato, Average, In Good Shape, Athletic, and Pro.
This parameter is considered when the app is generating a suitable route -- presumably by trying to adjust the elevation profile of the possible routes.
The user's real fitness is not taken into account.
\subsubsection*{Track difficulty assessment} 
Thanks to the maps provided by the OpenStreetMap, users are able to pick a starting point, a destination, as well as any number of waypoints in between for their route.
Once the route is chosen, the user can go through the route's stats - the estimated time it will take to get from start to finish, its length, the elevation profile (uphill, downhill, highest and lowest points, estimated average speed) and the surfaces and their use in proportion to the route's length.
All this information is delivered in easy-to-understand charts as well as interactive mappings -- using a slider, the user can see which stat applies in which part of the route.

    \caption{Overview of the route's surface. The detailed view is similar to the elevation detail.\cite{komoot-route-surface-overview-img}}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{Availability}
The region-based pricing model allows users who do not travel too much to use the app for free,
since the first region is provided at no cost.
In the other pricing options Single Region, Region Bundle and All Regions -- the price-performance ratio seems to grow at a reasonable scale.\todo[color = green]{anything to add?}
\subsubsection*{Community}
With features like sharing and recommending of routes users have taken, following of other users, upvoting and commenting on their posts, the mobile application integrates a full-fledged social network.
\subsubsection*{Extra features}
Komoot supports multiple sports, mainly hiking, running and multiple types of biking, to which it tailors the parameters of planned routes, such as mostly paved roads for road bikes and gravel for off-road biking.
There are other activities the app supported by the app, which, however, don't offer the customized planning and can only be set later.
These sports include skateboarding, skiing, climbing, and plenty of others.
This only serves as a tag for the user with no real impact.

If a user decides to skip all planning and just go into the world, their route can be ``recorded" for their use or the use of other komoot users, who can pick this route and either
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item follow it `as is', with all the possible deviations from the known network of streets and paths with the risk of impassable roads, or
    \item have komoot replan the off-grid segments and navigate through the known street network, or
    \item edit the route according to one's liking.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{User-friendliness}
The navigation through the mobile app takes some time to get used to -- it took me a while to find the Settings after I didn't see them in the burger menu on the bottom navigation bar, which contained only the different pricing options.
Once I created a route, the information provided was well-delivered and easy to read, however, there was no obvious way of completely cancelling the chosen route and picking another one.
Instead, hiding in the Options of the route -- which at first I didn't even notice -- I found the "Reset route" option, which did just what I needed.
Overall, the app has some great parts and some not-so-great ones.
\subsubsection*{Cross-platform}
The system is fully integrated with the Apple Watch and Samsung gear, and -- at least limitedly -- supports a number of other brands of smart watches and other Bluetooth-enabled devices.
The mobile application runs both on iPhones and Android phones.
\subsubsection*{Propriety}
The system is not entirely open-source, as a few of their repositories are public, but the core components remain proprietary. \todo[color = green]{recheck}\todo[color = green]{cite https://github.com/komoot}

\subsubsection*{Overall evaluation}
While being rich with features, komoot doesn't base its functionality on objective data -- it's the users themselves who rate and recommend the specific routes,
an approach in its nature prone to error and with only limited ways of eliminating the human factor.
%==============================================================================================
\subsection{endomondo}

Under Armour's endomondo application serves as a personal trainer for distance-based sports, such as running, cycling, or hiking.
Their main focus is on the endorphin release people get from encouragement and motivation -- this is why the app gives coaching advice, allows the users to send each other peptalks, and has over time built a global fitness community.
\subsubsection*{Use of IoT possibilities}
The application integrates with a wide range of watches and sensors, collecting data from GPS trackers, bike speed and cadence sensors, bike power sensors and heart rate measurement units.
Some basic statistics based on this data (such as average heart rate) is presented to the user with a free plan, 
while the more interesting statistics displayed with interactive graphs are for premium users only -- average heart rate history, heart rate zone analysis, even weather information collected from AccuWeather.com at the time of the workout.

The application uses other users' data to compare, \textit{how [the individual stacks] up against similar users}.\cite{endomondo-premium-features} \todo{ask the support what that means}
\subsubsection*{User fitness assessment}
The premium version of the application promises personal exercise plans for running goals, and the heart rate zones are calculated using the Karvonen formula: $((max HR − resting HR) × \% Intensity) + resting HR$,
however, endomondo's website doesn't say anything about how and when HRmax and HRmin are calculated, and the official support personnel does not have any additional information about what's written on their website.\cite{endomondo-HR-max-emails}
In spite of that, the values for the Karvonen formula are pre-filled when a user accesses the page, so they probably use age-based formulas to estimate all the variables.
In any case, they are all editable, so if the user already knows their HRmax for example from a laboratory test, they can use it.
When creating a new training plan (that is, having endomondo calculate the ``ideal'' plan for how a person should train if they want to run a specific distance on a specific day in the future),
one of the steps has the user choose a recent workout which will be used for calculating the individual's fitness level and for the plan generation.\cite{endomondo-training-plan-fitness-assessment}
A user's results are compared with other similar users, but the company's documentation provides no information how this is done.\cite{endomondo-HR-max-emails}\todo{recheck}
\subsubsection*{Availability}
Endomondo comes in two versions -- free and premium.
The free version has basic functionality, which is so limited that some have opted for free alternatives with more useful features such as Strava or Runmeter.\cite{endomondo-review}
It is supported by not too obtrusive ads on the bottom of the screen.

The premium version is ad-free, brings a number of features to the table and is based on a monthly subscription.

\subsubsection*{Community}
Endomondo's main focus in keeping their users on the platform is motivation, which is also demonstrated by the application's slogan -- ``Free your endorphines''.
One of their features is a real-time audio motivator, which makes comments on how well the user is doing compared to previous workouts,
encouraging them if they're lagging behind or  them about the personal record they are be about to hit.

Competing against oneself, however, isn't as much fun -- and therefore as motivating -- as getting to beat a friend or relative at the activity of choice.
This is why the application also integrates a social network of millions of users with functions like sharing one's activities, sending peptalks and  challenges.
\subsubsection*{Extra features}
After the end of the workout, you can answer a ``How was your workout?'', however, since this is a plain text option, this data is only for the user's later reading, and cannot be used in any machine processing.

A user can post photos in the description of the activity, as well use tags which are then used on social media.
With premium, one can filter based on these tags -- useful for tracking the number of miles that the user has run in a specific pair of shoes, or biked with a specific chain.
Other users can also be tagged, for example running partners or the person you're trying to beat in a challenge.

The premium version of the app also includes a few modes for interval training (periods of exercise alternating with periods of normal-to-high intensity training) as well as the option to build your own.
There are many applications that support this feature -- after all, it's just fairly basic time tracking -- but it's nice to have all the functionality in a single app.

\subsubsection*{Cross-platform}
All the features are available for iOS 9 and newer and Android 4.1 and newer.
Endomondo also used to be available on Blackberry and Windows phones.
\subsubsection*{Propriety}
The whole endomondo application only has a single public repository on github, which is a fork of tapiriik -- a tool for synchronization between different fitness applications, such as Endomondo, Garmin Connect, Strava, Runkeeper, and others.\cite{endomondo-tampiriik}

Otherwise, the whole application is completely proprietary.

\subsection{Garmin Explore and Garmin Connect}
The vast ecosystem Garmin has created for their users is filled with an assortment of wearables, radars, smart lights, navigations, customized maps, and plenty more, providing features which are presented to the user via modular mobile apps.

Here I will analyse the Garmin Explore application, which is targeted at hikers, in tandem with Garmin Connect, which functions as a fitness tracker.

\subsubsection*{Use of IoT possibilities}
Most fitness-focused Garmin watches do have a heart rate sensor and all of them include a step counter, however, this data is never compared with that of other users, keeping focus on the user's activity history with no prediction.
\subsubsection*{User fitness assessment}
Some of the heart-rate-monitor enabled watches allow a user to set the zones in which they would like to keep their heart rate depending on the activity they choose to do. The standard zones are:


\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/garmin-connect-myday-screen.png}
    \caption{My day - Garmin Connect's home screen displays statistics of the user's recent activity\cite{garmin-my-day-img}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Track difficulty assessment}

\subsubsection*{Availability}
In general, Garmin's pricing model relies on the user buying one of their high-end smartwatches, whereupon the rest of the components (apps, basic maps, support, etc.) are free, with some exceptions, such as advanced maps. 
The company's smartwatches are considered premium quality, with a wide price range - target groups include \textit{potential Rolex buyers}\cite{garmin-expensive} as well as ordinary users.\cite{garmin-watches-review}
\subsubsection*{Community}
The Connect application handles the data from the point of view of a fitness tracker, with social features like groups, competitions, likes, comments, and badges of accomplishment.\cite{garmin-connect}
\subsubsection*{Extra features} -- 
\subsubsection*{User-friendliness}

\subsubsection*{Cross-platform}
All of Garmin's applications can be installed both on Android and iPhone.
However, they can only be paired with watches inside Garmin's ecosystem, which is a drawback for users who already own a smartwatch.
\subsubsection*{Propriety}
Some of the Garmin applications are completely open-source, either due to the software that they are derived from, or simply to provide the general public with opportunity to customize their Garmin experience.\cite{garmin-open-source}\cite{garmin-connect-github-repos}
These apps are mostly concerned with map handling, navigation and sound codecs, but also include some bits of functionality like widgets, low power watch apps and others.

While some of this code may be used in the Explore or Connect applications, these repositories don't contain their core functionality.

\subsubsection*{Overall evaluation}
As a fitness tracker, Garmin Connect can definitely be considered acceptable...

\subsection{Existing solutions analysis}
There's a plethora of applications taking advantage of wearable tech, not all of them using the available bio sensors from basic real-time heart rate monitoring to progress tracking, to calorie measuring, and to social network sized fitness communities.

In this chapter I will research a couple \todo[color = green]{reword} such applications, compare and rate them based on following criteria.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use of IoT possibilities -- data collection from the community, big data
    \item Use of sensors
    \item User fitness assessment -- self-assessment, questionnaire
    \item similarity in features \todo[color = green]{reword}
    \item Community -- built-in sharing options
    \item Extra features
    \item User-friendliness
    \item Availability -- free/microtransactions/paid
    \item Cross-platform -- major operating systems supporting the mobile application and sensors, if any are used \todo[color = green]{reword}
    \item Propriety -- open-source, closed-source
\end{itemize}


\subsection{komoot}
The cross-platform application for outdoor track suggestion can also be used as a tour planner, guide and a navigation system.

While being rich with features, komoot doesn't base its functionality on objective data - it's the users themselves who rate and recommend the specific 'routes' (as they are named here),
which in its nature \todo[color = green]{wording} is prone to error and there are only limited ways of eliminating the human factor.

Moreover, since the app is not open source, \todo[color = green]{finish sentence}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use of IoT possibilities -- komoot doesn't quite qualify as an Iot solution, since it doesn't use any sensors other than GPS and requires user input for track rating.
    \item Use of sensors -- The smart watch only gets used for displaying of routes and navigation, not taking any advantage of the available sensors.
    \item Availability -- The region-based pricing model allows users who do not travel too much to use the app for free,
    since the first region is provided at no extra cost.
    In the other pricing options -- Single Region, Region Bundle and All Regions -- the price-performance ratio seems to be scaled reasonably. \todo[color = green]{anything to add?}
    \item Cross-platform -- The system has full support with the Apple Watch and Samsung gear, and -- at least limitedly -- supports a number of other brands of smart watches and other Bluetooth-enabled devices.
    \item Propriety -- the system is not entirely open-source, as a few of their repositories are public, but the core components remain hidden. \todo[color = green]{recheck}
    \item 
\end{itemize}

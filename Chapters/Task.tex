Analysis of an IoT solution for assessment of tourist track physical difficulty using smart wearables

The aim of this thesis is to analyse, design and implement a PoC IoT solution for tourist track difficulty estimation.\todo[color=green]{add a dictionary of shortcuts - slovník pojmov}
Using a mobile application, the user shall be able to select a track and assess how much effort the specific part of the track would require from them, based on data collected from similarly fit users.
\todo[color=green]{reword into sentences, no points}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Analyse and compare similar existing solutions.
    \item Analyse and design an IoT solution for data processing.
    \item Design a mobile application for data visualization and track selection.
    \item Create a PoC of the IoT platform and of the mobile application.
    \item Demonstrate the solution's functionality on a relevant use case, using real data collected from smart wearables.
\end{enumerate}

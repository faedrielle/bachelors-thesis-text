Analysis of an IoT solution for assessment of tourist track physical difficulty

The aim of this thesis is to analyse, design and implement a proof-of-concept \todo[color=green]{maybe change the way the acronyms are introduced?} (PoC) Internet-of-Things (IoT) solution for tourist track difficulty estimation.\todo[color=green]{add a dictionary of shortcuts - slovn√≠k pojmov}
Using a mobile application, the user shall be able to select a track and assess how difficult the specific part of the track will be for them, based on data collected from similarly fit users.
\todo[color=green]{reword into sentences, no points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyse and compare similar existing solutions.
    \item Analyse and design an IoT solution for data processing.
    \item Design a mobile application for data visualization and track selection.
    \item Create a PoC of the IoT platform and of the mobile application.
    \item Collect raw data from smart watch heart rate sensors and smart phone GPS locators, and propose relevant statistics to process this data. \todo{JK: What is the purpose of this point? I understand it as a part of the design. Don't you mean a use case?}\todo[color=green]{pick usecase to show on real data DEMONSTRATE}

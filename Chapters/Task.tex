Analysis of an IoT system for assessment of tourist track physical difficulty

The aim of this thesis is to analyse, design and implement a proof-of-concept (PoC) IoT solution for tourist track difficulty estimation.
Using a mobile application, the user shall be able to select a track and assess how difficult the specific part of the track will be for them, based on data collected from similarly fit users.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyse and compare similar existing solutions.
    \item Create a PoC IoT platform for data processing.
    \item Design a mobile application for data visualization and track selection.
    \item Create a PoC mobile application to collect and send data to the IoT platform.
    \item Collect raw data from smart watch heart rate monitors and smart phone GPS locators.
    \item Propose relevant statistics based on collected data.
\end{itemize}
